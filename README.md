## Brief Description

This is a minimal Minecraft mod that adds new types of torches to the game.

## Introduction

Have you ever gone adventuring with a friend and wished you had a way to tell your paths apart? Or that you had a cheap and movable material with which to plan building foundations? Well then this might be the mod for you! With this mod you can craft torches with colourful bands on them. What those bands are used for is completely up to you!

## Crafting

Simply combine a torch and one of the sixteen standard dyes (or equivalents from other mods) into a crafting grid. That's it!

If you don't want the band on your torch anymore, you can place your banded torch into a crafting grid and recover the normal torch.

If your configuration allows it (see below), you can apply a band from one torch to another. You don't need one dye per torch.

## Configuration

`allowTorchDuplicationRecipe` : Allows you to quickly make new banded torches from an existing one and a normal torch. Avoids having to farm dyes. Default is `true`.

`useDistinctInventoryIcon` : (Client-side only) Torch icons will be taken from `textures/items` rather than using the block texture (`textures/blocks`). The icons included with the mod should help to more easily distinguish the banded torches from the original torch and from each other (especially when the stack counter is higher). Default is `true`.

## FAQ

**Are there any dependencies?**

No. I might add optional dependencies sometime in the future, but my intention is to keep this mod required dependency-free.

**Are there any incompatibilities?**

There are no incompatibilities that I am aware of at the time of writing. I expect that the banded torches added by this mod might not adopt functionality from other mods added to normal torches (e.g. usable in multipart blocks, for example), but you might try it anyway just to see.

**Will you be updating this mod to Minecraft version X?**

Possibly. But I do not plan to maintain multiple Minecraft versions in parallel. I plan to wait until enough players and mods have migrated to another Minecraft version, then make the switch. As such it's possible that I will skip over certain (less used) Minecraft versions.

## Miscellaneous Information

The mod is provided as-is without guarantee or warranty of any kind. I strongly suggest backing up existing worlds before installing *any* mod.

Please go ahead and use this in modpacks, Youtube videos, Twitch streams, etc. I'd be happy if you let me know that you at least like the mod, but it isn't absolutely essential.

If you find problems or have questions, the best place for letting me know is the project's GitHub page.
